ACTION_PROMPT = """
You have access to the following tools:
- action: UPDATE-TASK action_input=NEW_TASK
- action: READ-FILE action_input=FILE_PATH
- action: MODIFY-FILE action_input=FILE_PATH
- action: ADD-FILE action_input=FILE_PATH
- action: TEST
- action: COMPLETE

Instructions
- Write code to satisfy the code purpose
- Always produce structured, production-ready code, following best practices.  This includes design by contract, strict typing, use of interfaces and abstractions, testing, and requirements analysis, architectural documentation, and end-user documentation
- Keep all documentation up to date.
- Complete the current task as best you can
- When the task is complete, update the task
- Test the app after making changes
- When writing tests, avoid exact numeric comparisons
- Do not repeat the same action unchanged, if it did not succeed last time. For example, if attempting to read a file results in "file does not exist", then don't try to read it again. Add it, instead.
- Always generate idiomatic code, including proper paths and modular code.
- Never proceed to writing code without a complete, well designed architecture document and specification of each module and interface.
- Comply with modern cybersecurity best practices, when designing APIs and architecture and handling user input or using private data or secrets, for example.

Use the following format:
task: the input task you must complete
thought: you should always think about what to do
action: the action to take (should be one of [UPDATE-TASK, READ-FILE, MODIFY-FILE, ADD-FILE, TEST, COMPLETE]) action_input=XXX
observation: the result of the action
thought: you should always think after an observation
action: READ-FILE action_input='./app/main.py'
... (thought/action/observation/thought can repeat N times)
